Here’s 1 slide-ready, detailed but easy English explanation of Prompt Caching — perfect for presentations:
📌 Prompt Caching — Explained Simply
🔹 What Is Prompt Caching?
Prompt caching is a technique used in AI systems where a large, repeated prompt (prefix) is stored so it doesn’t need to be re-processed every time a request is sent.
In other words:
We reuse the computed context instead of recalculating it each time.
🔹 Why Does This Matter?
AI models charge and spend time based on how much they process.
If the same big prompt is sent repeatedly:
🕒 It wastes time to recompute it every time.
💰 It costs more tokens and money.
Prompt caching avoids this by reusing previous work.
🔹 How It Works (Simple Steps)
You send a long, stable prefix (instructions, rules, glossary).
The system processes it once and caches the result.
Next request with the same prefix + cache key → the AI reuses the stored context.
This is called a cache hit.
If the prefix changes (even slightly), or the cache key changes → the cache no longer matches.
This is a cache miss and the system recalculates from scratch.
🔹 Benefits of Prompt Caching
✔️ Faster responses
✔️ Lower compute cost & fewer tokens used
✔️ Consistent behavior across similar calls
✔️ Better performance at scale
🔹 When Does It Work Best?
✅ When you always send the same long instructions before the user prompt
✅ Shared foundation text across many calls
⚠️ It breaks if the prefix changes even by one character
🔹 One-Line Summary
Prompt caching saves time and cost by reusing already processed prompt context instead of recomputing it every time.
